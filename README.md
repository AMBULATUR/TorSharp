};

// download tools
await new TorSharpToolFetcher(settings, new HttpClient()).FetchAsync();

// execute
var proxy = new TorSharpProxy(settings);
var handler = new HttpClientHandler
{
    Proxy = new WebProxy(new Uri("http://localhost:" + settings.PrivoxyPort))

## FAQ

### The tool fetcher is throwing an exception. What do I do?

This most likely is happening because the URLs where we fetch Tor or Privoxy from are down or have changed. I would
recommend:

1. [Open an issue](https://github.com/joelverhagen/TorSharp/issues/new) so I can look into it.

1. Work around the issue by setting up the tools manually and not using `TorSharpToolFetcher`.
   [See below](#how-do-i-set-up-the-tools-manually).

1. Investigate the issue yourself. The
   [TorSharp.Sandbox](https://github.com/joelverhagen/TorSharp/blob/release/TorSharp.Sandbox/Program.cs) project is
   helpful for this. Pull requests accepted üèÜ.

### How do I set up the tools manually?

If you don't want to use the `TorSharpToolFetcher` to download the latest version of the tools for you or if you want
to use a specific version of Tor and Privoxy, follow these steps.

1. Make a directory that will hold the zipped Tor and Privoxy binaries.
1. Put a Tor Win32 ZIP in that folder with the file name like: `tor-win32-{version}.zip`
   - `{version}` must be parsable as a `System.Version` meaning it is `major.minor[.build[.revision]]`.
   - Example: `tor-win32-0.3.5.8.zip`
   - The ZIP is expected to have `Tor\tor.exe`.
1. Put a Privoxy Win32 ZIP in that folder with a file name like: `privoxy-win32-{version}.zip`
   - Again, `{version}` must be parsable as a `System.Version`.
   - Example: `privoxy-win32-3.0.26.zip`
   - The ZIP is expected to have `privoxy.exe`.
1. Initialize a `TorSharpSettings` instance where `ZippedToolsDirectory` is the directory created above.
1. Pass this settings instance to the `TorSharpProxy` constructor.
